Error: between 0 and levels - 1
Correction: between 0 and levels
Explanation: It is possible that sDotN is 1.0, so (1.0 * levels) will equal levels and subsequently floor(levels) would also be equal levels. 
  In other words, there are (levels + 1) possible values, with the highest level being the least likely. Could this be fixed 
  by making sure that sDotN is clamped to [0.0, 1.0 - epsilon]?
